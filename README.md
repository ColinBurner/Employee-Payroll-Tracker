# Employee Payroll Tracker Assignment
This is a website that logs employee data using JavaScript.

## What I did to accomplish goals in this project
I used functions to collect employee data, display that data, calculate the average salary, display the average salary in the console and choose a random employee.

## How I accomplished my goals with this project
I used the collect employees function to create an array of objects using user input. I used the prompt method to gather this data. When the data is gathered successfully, it is automatically placed in a table. I then used calculate average function to calculate the average salary, then the display average salary function to log the average salary to the console. I then used the get random employee function to choose an employee at random to be logged to the console as a drawing winner.

This screenshot shows the JavaScript code that functions to collect the employee data using the prompt method.

## Usage
Upon clicking the "add employees" button you are prompted to enter a first name, last name and their salary. When a full employee's data is input, a new prompt comes up asking if you would like to continue, to continue click OK, to finish click cancel. When all employees have been input, the code sorts the data, calculates the average salary and then logs it to the console. The code also chooses a random employee to win a drawing which is also logged to the console along with the array of employees entered by the user.
